#load.link

Easily upload files to your HTTP server and share them with your friends using a nice link.

Just put `index.php` in an empty directory with write permissions and browse to it. The installation process is straightforward: just choose a password and start uploading!


### Requirements

- PHP >= 5.3.0
- PECL hash >= 1.1
- PECL fileinfo >= 0.1.0


### Work in progress

There's also a fully functional CLI client written in Python (`lluploader.py`), but as it isn't packaged yet and uses custom libraries you might have some difficulties using it if you're not 1337 enough.

But worry not: functional prepackaged GUI clients for all major platforms are coming soon!

If you like Go or (rightfully) hate PHP you should take a look at [moshee/airlift](https://github.com/moshee/airlift). Also his CLI client has a cooler progress bar.
